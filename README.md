# NFT Marketplace

This project is based on Nader Dabit's tutorial "How to Build a Full Stack NFT Marketplace on Ethereum with Polygon and Next.js"

The first couple of commits have essentially the same code that Nader writes on the tutorial, while other changes are and will be added by me in subsequent commits.

Special thanks to Nader Dabit for taking the time to create such an amazing tutorial. [Link to tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKJBEEXUha0)

Below is just the default Readme added by Hardhat.

# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
